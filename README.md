To run the project properly, follow the steps below:

1. **Install dependencies** 
  You need to install dependencies in all three folders: `subscriptionTest`, `backend`, and `frontend`:
  - yarn install

2. To run both projects, access `subscriptionTest` folder and run the following command (This will run both servers concurrently).
  - yarn start

3. Create envirorment variables below:
  - **Backend** (backend/.env):
      NODE_ENV=development
      PORT=3001
      MONGO_HOST=localhost
      MONGO_PORT=27017
      MONGO_DB_NAME=test

  - **Frontend** (frontend/.env):
      BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
      API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api

4. To run the projects seperatly, run the following commands:
  - For BACKEND:
    cd backend
    yarn dev

  - For FRONTEND:

    yarn dev

# NOTES
- The project structure, environment setup, and `.gitignore` were manually configured.
- The frontend uses the Mantine UI library to help build a modern and responsive user interface.
- This project was designed with scalability and clean code in mind. It includes centralized API handling, global error management, and a shared task context for state management on the frontend.
